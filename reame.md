Welcome to Bamazon customer edition!

This is a readme.md to instruct you about how this program works.

There are three main objectives of this demonstration:
  1. Setting up a database with prices and quantity
  2. Accessing the database through Node
  3. Making changes to the database

  See picture #1 to see what the list of produce that we will be selling in the Bamazon. Each item is unique and carries prices.

  Choose one of the ids and this will be used to target one of the products.

  Then you will input an amount of the product you'd like to produce.


This selection will compare the amount you want with the inventory(stock_quantity) in Bamazon. If you do not have enough in your inventory, then you will receive an error message and will have to try again.

If you have enough inventory, then this will update the server and it will show the difference.
